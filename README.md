#### Hey folks 👋, I'm André
> I craft software and love conversations about maintaining and running code on production.

- I’m currently working at Red Hat as an Architect.
- As a modern software engineer, I enjoy climbing.
- Fun fact I was a blood elf, holy paladin with high rio. But now I am a royal paladin.
