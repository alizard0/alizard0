#### Hey folks ðŸ‘‹, I'm AndrÃ©
> I craft software and love conversations about maintaining and running code on production.

- Iâ€™m currently working at Red Hat as Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat Developer Hub.
- As a modern software engineer, I enjoy climbing.
- Fun fact I was a blood elf, holy paladin with high rio. But now I am a royal paladin in Tibia.
